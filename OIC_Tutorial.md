# Oracle Integration Cloud: The Tutorial

This document shows how to use Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) at the very basic level.


## Purpose

Before you get started, please note that this tutorial is **meant for beginners**. Every step builds on all previous steps, so if you understand a step feel free to skip that step -- please still read all of this document to make sure you did not miss any key configuration steps. Here is a more detailed list of what this tutorial will cover:
- How to navigate to and from OIC, starting from the cloud login dashboard
- How to build a connection
- How to create and run a simple integration: REST endpoints
- How to track your integration instance
- Locations of various important pieces of information
	- e.g. Activity Log, Variable Tracking

Here is what you'll need for the tutorial that is **NOT** covered in this tutorial (i.e. prerequisites):
- Oracle Cloud tenancy
- An application to integrate with (this is provided, but feel free to try to connect OIC to your own application after you complete this tutorial)
- other stuff??

By the end of this tutorial, it is expected that you will be able to create your own integrations and know where to get help if you get stuck. Don't be afraid to search the internet for a specific error, the REST API catalog on OIC, or just general information on something you noticed while playing around with the OIC dashboard.
